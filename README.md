# Gitlet
## The principle of Gitlet 
In principle, Gitlet is no different from Git. Both save the contents of all files in a version and allow switching between different versions, ensuring that all existing versions are not lost. So, how do you distinguish a version? The answer is to create a version snapshot with the "commit" command. It's like taking a photo of that moment with a camera and stringing the photos together in order. When you want to go back to a certain version, you just have to flip back in sequence. The following illustration shows the basic principle of Gitlet.
