# Gitlet
In this project you'll be implementing a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. Ours is smaller and simpler, however, so we have named it Gitlet.

In principle, Gitlet is no different from Git. Both save the contents of all files in a version and allow switching between different versions, ensuring that all existing versions are not lost. So, how do you distinguish a version? The answer is to create a version snapshot with the "commit" command. It's like taking a photo of that moment with a camera and stringing the photos together in order. When you want to go back to a certain version, you just have to flip back in sequence. The following illustration shows the basic principle of Gitlet.
